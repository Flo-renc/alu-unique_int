This project is about data structures and algorithims to remove duplicates, non-integers and very large numbers from sample input files by using datastructure hashset and algorithm timesort. And writing those numbers in asscending order. The reason I have chosen Hashset or hashmaps (set()) and timesort (sorted()) it provides an average O(1) time complexity for insertion and lookup orperations. O(1) makes it faster because there is no relationship between the speed nad lookup of the collection or size of the data. 
updated while going through the instruction I realised that using the built in libraries, sort and data type set does not adhere to the instructions of not using libraries. My updated code uses bubble sort function to sort the list of integers without using sorted and remove duplicate function to remove dublicates without using set() data type.
